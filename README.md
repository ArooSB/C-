# C-Plus-Plus

What's C++?
C++ is considered the greatest OOP language for large-scale applications. C++ extends C.

Java, based on C++, is optimised for online program object delivery. Java is simpler, easier to understand, and has 
numerous advantages over C++. However, both languages require extensive study.

C++ lets programmers define and modify data types with functions and methods. It supports low-level programming and 
memory access, making code execution rapid. Templates provide flexible programming and reuse for diverse data types.

System software, games, embedded systems, scientific computing, and high-performance applications employ C++. 
The C++ standard library makes sophisticated software development easy with its coding facilities and functions.
C++ runs on Linux, Mac, and Windows.

Object-oriented programming uses classes, attributes, objects, and methods.

Learn C++ with online tutorials, courses, and interactive challenges. C++ programmers require a compiler 
to convert code into machine-readable instructions. Microsoft Visual C++, Clang, and GNU Compiler Collection 
are C++ compilers. After installing a compiler, developers can write C++ code in a text editor or IDE. IDEs have 
code completion, debugging, and administration tools.

Typical C++ program structure is functions. Computer programs start with the main() function. Loops and conditionals 
let developers regulate program flow. C++ has libraries with prebuilt functions and data structures for common tasks.
